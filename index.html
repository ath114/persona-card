        <h1>Edward The "Floating Funds" Roommate</h1>
        <h2>Student House Organizer</h2>
        <p class="bio">Lives with 4 other students who owe him money. 
            Uses group chats and Venmo, but often gets “left on read.”
            “I currently have about $80 floating out there that I haven't been paid back for,
             and I have to remind my roommates three times just to get a Venmo response.”</p>

                <h3>Goals</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Financial Fairness: Wants a system to accurately split bills that contain both shared household goods and personal items.</li><br>
                    <li>Operational Efficiency: Prefers a standard shopping schedule so everyone knows what to expect and avoids "fridge tetris" caused by buying duplicate items like milk or eggs.</li><br>
                    <li>Timely Communication: Desires a convenient way to update the household on what food is needed before someone goes to the store.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Frustrations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Administrative Friction: Exhausted by the "manual work" and "human initiative" required to calculate totals and request payments.
 "Usually, I notice we are out of trash bags or olive oil. I text our group chat, 'Hey, we need X.' Everyone leaves me on read."
</li><br>
                    <li>Social Stress: Feels awkwardness and stress when roommates are unwilling to cooperate or pay back their share promptly.
"I calculate the total, divide it by four, and send Venmo requests. Then I have to remind them three times to actually pay me."
</li><br>
                    <li>Inconsistent Contributions: Frustrated by the "rotation system" where one person buys luxury items and the next buys the cheapest possible version.
"The 'rotation' system fails when someone buys the cheapest, single-roll toilet paper when it is their turn, after I bought the luxury 24-pack."
